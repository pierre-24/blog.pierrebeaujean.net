Hey, I'm *Pierre Beaujean*.
I'm a >30 years old male, living in Belgium.

## Science

I have a Ph.D. in quantum chemistry (obtained in October 2021 in the university of Namur). 

Currently, I am a postdoctoral researcher on the ECOBAT (EOS) project, to study new batteries from a quantum chemistry point of view. 
My goal is to study new batteries from a quantum chemistry level, more specifically focusing on the interface between the anode and the electrolyte, the [solid electrolyte interphase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium%E2%80%93silicon_battery#Solid_electrolyte_interphase_layer) (SEI) layer.
To do so, I use different quantum chemistry code such as [Gaussian](https://gaussian.com/), [VASP](https://www.vasp.at/), and [CP2K](https://www.cp2k.org/).
Thought I mostly use DFT, I have also experience with other post-HF methods such as MP2 or Coupled Cluster.

If you want to know more, my public CV is available [here](https://pierrebeaujean.net/).

## Computer programming

I also recently (June 2020) obtained a bachelor in Computer Science, following years of autodidact training.
I mostly code in [Python](https://www.python.org/) (with the different parts of the [scipy](https://scipy.org/) stack) and sometimes in C (with [OpenMP](https://openmp.llvm.org/) and [MPI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_Passing_Interface)).
I also have knowledges in HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

I have developed different projects over the years, mostly to help me during my scientific carrier.

### Active projects:

+ [`cp2k-basis`](https://github.com/pierre-24/cp2k-basis), a library to parse CP2K basis sets and GTH pseudopotentials, which also comes with a [web service](https://cp2k-basis.pierrebeaujean.net/) to find out and select a basis set and its matching pseudopotential for your CP2K calculations.
+ [`ec-interface`](https://github.com/pierre-24/ec-interface), a set of tools to create electrochemical interface calculations (for VASP).
+ [`just-psf`](https://github.com/pierre-24/just-psf), a set of tools to create a (quick and dirty) topology to be used with VMD.
+ [`nachos`](https://github.com/pierre-24/nachos), a code for the calculation of the different quantities coming from numerical differentiation of energy (oriented toward computation of vibrational contributions). 
+ [`phonopy-vibspec`](https://github.com/pierre-24/phonopy-vibspec), tools to simulate IR and Raman spectra with Phonopy.
+ [`pyiso4`](https://github.com/pierre-24/pyiso4), an implementation of the ISO 4 standard for journal titles abbreviations in Python. 
+ [`qcip_tools`](https://github.com/pierre-24/qcip_tools) (Quantum Chemistry In Python (QCIP) tools package): a library to parse and use the output of some quantum chemistry files.
+ [`scalapacke`](https://github.com/pierre-24/scalapacke), create the missing C headers (as well as some wrappers) for scaLAPACK.
+ [`stdlite`](https://github.com/pierre-24/stdlite), a light-weight sTD-DFT library and runner.
+ [`vasp-opt-follows`](https://github.com/pierre-24/vasp-opt-follows), follows different criterion of an optimization done with VASP.

### Active non-scientific projects:

+ The [website](https://github.com/pierre-24/AM-Nihoul-website) of the [Association Anne-Marie Nihoul](https://annemarienihoul.be/), a non-profit organisation to help financially and psychologically cancer patients.
+ [`pics.pierrebeaujean.net)`](https://github.com/pierre-24/pics.pierrebeaujean.net), my own gallery generator for <https://pics.pierrebeaujean.net>.
+ [`pierrebeaujean.net`](https://github.com/pierre-24/pierrebeaujean.net), the code that generate my CV, located at <https://pierrebeaujean.net>.
+ [`pytimefliplib`](https://github.com/pierre-24/pytimefliplib), a python library to deal with [TimeFlip](https://timeflip.io/) v3 and v4.

### Dormant/archived projects:

+ [`helmhurts-python`](https://github.com/pierre-24/helmhurts-python), solve the Helmholtz equation to model the amplitude field of wireless.
+ [`logical-enough`](https://github.com/pierre-24/logical-enough), a small website to test student's knowledge of search expressions.
+ [`pybibtex`](https://github.com/pierre-24/pybibtex), provides a Python API to parse BibTeX files.
+ [`pytexcount`](https://github.com/pierre-24/pytexcount), count the number of words in a TeX document, but tries to be clever about it. 
+ [`timeflip-tt`](https://github.com/pierre-24/timeflip-tt), a lightweight custom time tracker based on TimeFlip.
